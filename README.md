"# Lab-Report-Digitalization-LRD" 

Insurance companies regularly gets health check reports submitted by potential buyers of insurance. We need a way to digitize different kinds of printed lab reports / health check reports to discrete values of each parameter captured. Conversion to a standardized set of digitized value will help in automating lot of backend approval process. Ability to read and classify comments/observations for common parameters will be a big plus When a customer is uploading his health check report regularly, then also a trend chart can be plotted for key parameters.
